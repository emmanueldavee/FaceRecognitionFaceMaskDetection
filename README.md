# Face Recognition with Face Mask Detection
Experimented with LBPH Face Recognizer and MobileNet for Mask Detection. Details regarding the project are explained in **Report.pdf**. Code implementation can be checked on the following files:

1. **FaceRec Training.ipynb**: LBPH Face Recognizer Training for Face Recognition

2. **MaskTraining.ipynb**: MobileNet Deep Learning Training for Mask Detection

3. **Detector.ipynb**: final application that integrates Face Recognition with Mask Detection

The face detection used are haarcascade classifier and OpenCV's DNN Caffe Model.

Training dataset for mask detection is retrieved from kaggle datasets download -d omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
Training dataset for face recognition is retrieved from Laboratory Project

Demo is shown in **demo.mp4**
